This is the app API (REST API built with Spring Boot Framework) <br>
I had deployed the AWS RDS instance's endpoint URL as Base URL of Retrofit Client and used <br>
AWS RDS as cloud storage to understand the basics of cloud services. <br>
Since it was a free tier version for temporary days hence presently the REST API works on localhost server for the demonstration. <br>
Kindly replace the Base URL in Retrofit Client file with your machine's IPv4 address as currently it will work on local MySQL database.
